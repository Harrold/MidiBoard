# MidiBoard
A sound player which allows assigning sounds to buttons on a midi controller. This is tested on an Akai Fire Midi Controller.

This player makes use of the libremidi project. https://github.com/jcelerier/libremidi

TODO: 
Lots. Lots of verifications for profiles, sounds, memory management, etc...
